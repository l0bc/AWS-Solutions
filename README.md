### Accounts
* A container for identities (users) and Resources
  * Each account has an Account ROOT user. \[no restriction\]
* IAM Service
  * Create dif identities (users, groups, roles) with FULL or LIMITED permissions (more in depth later).

A good practice would be to create new account for DEV, TEST, PROD.
